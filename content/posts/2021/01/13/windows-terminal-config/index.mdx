title: Windows Terminal Config - Make it Your Own

I've been using the Windows Terminal now since the summer, it's great
and I now prefer it over Hyper which was my preferred terminal.

Windows Terminal comes with a lot of options for configuration and a
load more which I've only just discovered after researching this post!

Dope!

## First impressions

When I first opened the app I was greeted with PowerShell as the
initial tab, there's a dropdown menu to choose from one of PowerShell,
(default), Command Prompt or Azure Cloud Shell.

So it looks like the standard Command Prompt (sort of), I went about
finding if I could change that and was pleasantly surprised.

The Windows Terminal team have done an awesome job of documenting all
aspects of the Terminal.

## Included Themes

The first thing I did was try work out how to change the theme
(priorities! ðŸ˜‚) and it wasn't as simple as adding a string to a
plugins array like with Hyper term.

The Windows Terminal has a `settings.json` file to manage the
configuration with a _lot_ of options! I'll come onto this soon, it's
split into several sections:

- Profiles
- Schemes
- Keybindings

Anyway back to the theme, important stuff right! So there's seven
included colour schemes (themes) that come with the Windows Terminal:

- [Campbell]
- [Campbell PowerShell]
- [Vintage]
- [One Half Dark]
- [One Half Light]
- [Tango Dark]
- [Tango Light]

The change to any of those I have to open the `settings.json` with
Ctrl+, then I'm presented with the big boi config, I want to apply the
theme Tango Dark to every tab that I open in the terminal so I'll add
it in the `profiles` object:

```json
"profiles": {
  "defaults": {
    // Put settings here that you want to apply to all profiles.
    "colorScheme": "Tango Dark"
  },
}
```

## Other config options

There's also some other config options I like to set for the defaults,
these are the font, font size and the cursor shape and colour:

```json
"profiles": {
  "defaults": {
    // Put settings here that you want to apply to all profiles.
    "fontFace": "Victor Mono",
    "fontSize": 15,
    "colorScheme": "Tango Dark",
    "cursorShape": "filledBox",
    "cursorColor": "#639"
    // "cursorHeight": 85 // use with vintage cursorShape
  }
}
```

â„¹ I discovered the additional cursor options by hitting Ctrl+space bar
to bring up the intellisense options:

If you're tired of looking through the themes on the website you can
check out the [Windows Terminal Themes GitHub `themes.json` file]
(it's a chonka!).

## Use your own Theme

You may have noticed in the last image there that the theme isn't one
of the provided themes.

I wasn't happy with the provided theming options so went to find a
custom one to use, luckily for me there's [Windows Terminal Themes]
which is a a very large selection of pre made themes.

You can [create your own theme] in the Windows Terminal but I went for
one of the ones available on the Windows Terminal Themes site
`Builtin Solarized Dark`.

The way to use it is, copy the theme object from the site and paste it
into the `schemes` array part of the `settings.json` file.

In it's initial state the `schemes` array is empty:

```json
// Add custom color schemes to this array.
// To learn more about color schemes, visit https://aka.ms/terminal-color-schemes
"schemes": [],
```

I add the theme object to the `schemes` array then I need to set it
for the default, which means any tab I open for Ubuntu, Debian etc
will have the same theme.

The `shemes` array with the new theme in there:

```json
// Add custom color schemes to this array.
// To learn more about color schemes, visit https://aka.ms/terminal-color-schemes
"schemes": [
  {
    "name": "Builtin Solarized Dark",
    "black": "#073642",
    "red": "#dc322f",
    "green": "#859900",
    "yellow": "#b58900",
    "blue": "#268bd2",
    "purple": "#d33682",
    "cyan": "#2aa198",
    "white": "#eee8d5",
    "brightBlack": "#002b36",
    "brightRed": "#cb4b16",
    "brightGreen": "#586e75",
    "brightYellow": "#657b83",
    "brightBlue": "#839496",
    "brightPurple": "#6c71c4",
    "brightCyan": "#93a1a1",
    "brightWhite": "#fdf6e3",
    "background": "#002b36",
    "foreground": "#839496"
  }
]
```

Then in `profiles`, `defaults` section add in the colour scheme:

```json
"profiles": {
  "defaults": {
    // Put settings here that you want to apply to all profiles.
    "fontFace": "Builtin Solarized Dark",
    "fontSize": 15,
    "colorScheme": "Tango Dark",
    "cursorShape": "filledBox",
    "cursorColor": "#639"
    // "cursorHeight": 85 // use with vintage cursorShape
  }
}
```

Bingo bango, new theme for all my new terminal tabs I open!

## Profiles

So I can have a nice theme for the terminal now, nice font, yay! What
now if I want to have a different theme for when I'm in Ubuntu and
Debian? (I use a lot of Windows Subsystem for Linux instances)

## Schemes

I've already covered `schemes` in theming, this is where I can dump
all the themes I want to use for all the different profiles I can
create in the profiles object!ðŸ”¥

## Keybindings

## Background images

If you ever find reference to `ms-appdata:///roaming` for Windows
Terminal, that's translated into:

```ps
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState
```
