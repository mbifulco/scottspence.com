I started playing around with the GitHub GraphQL API endpoint to do
something I've been meaning to do for a wile now, that's to make a
serverless function that will return the GitHub stats from my GitHub
profile.

Me doing this came up in conversation my friend [Paul Scanlon] and he
decided to do something similar with the GitHub REST API, so we are
making notes on how things are going!!

What I'm doing is based off of several Leigh Halliday videos on using
the GitHub GraphQL API and adding that data to a graph, I extended
that and added a calendar/heatmap of all my GitHu contributions too.

I wanted to use Playwright but that didn't work on Vercel so a
reverted to Puppeteer like with the serverless open graph image
project I made a while back now.

I went with Google chart library first as it had what I needed
(Pie/Doughnut and Heatmap) but it's not responsive.
