All the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I use Ubuntu 20.04 in place of Windows now. Windows is still
a good platform for web development and if you are a Windows user you
can see how to use Windows Subsystem Linux for web development in
[this guide], I also made a video for setting up [Ubuntu for web
development].

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan, I have a Spotify playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/4etN3fawLp5rWiAFdJZQp5?si=bWljWzzsTq2kFj6hq5f-lQ"
  width="100%"
/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be the UKF Drum and Bass Top 50:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/0Zarq4BVkFkZOWkmqsfrjA?si=x3WLxJnVS12NVWWDt1LUXg"
  width="100%"
/>

### Now Playing - Spotify ðŸŽ§

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:

  Dell 452-BBOO USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station.
- Keyboard is now a [Logitech G815], I [made some notes] on it as
  well.
- Microphone, a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser Microphone]
  which is surprisingly good quality for the price.

booting Windows with Pop!\_OS by System76

  Owl] ðŸ¦‰ theme

  sessions.
